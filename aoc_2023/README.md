## Why Common Lisp?

I enjoy coding in the LISP family of languages and having read the Practical Common Lisp book _a while ago_, was keen to find a reason to use the language.

Advent of Code doesn't lend itself well to exploring the more interesting features of CL (such as restarts), but nonetheless is a good opportunity to write code in the language.

## Note

The solutions do not follow any particular structure, and are in most cases quite messy.
